## Hey! I'm Krafter.

> **⚠️ I'm currently redoing this site!** Please bear with me.
 
Programmer, Sysadmin, Linux user, Minecrafter, PC Builder, Transportation supporter, Car-hater, Train nerd, and Fediverse enthusiast.

I daily drive [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org//) and [LineageOS for microG](https://lineage.microg.org/). I [self-host things](/projects#hosting) and [write code](/projects).

I love Minecraft, Dungeons & Dragons, and whatever lets me hang out with chill people.

Some other things to check out:
