# Krafter

## Hey! I'm Krafter.
 
I do a bit of contribution to FOSS projects, because there are so many great projects our there ([see my GitHub Stars](https://github.com/TheKrafter?tab=stars))

I am a Linux user, and I use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) on my desktop and laptop. My phone is a OnePlus 7 running [LineageOS for microG](http://lineage.microg.org/). I self-host a few things for myself aswell on a Fedora Server system at home, and a debian proxy on Contabo:
- [ActualBudget](https://actualbudget.org/)
- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
- [Airsonic](https://airsonic.github.io/)
- Minecraft ([Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper), behind [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/paper))
- [UptimeKuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/)

I also play games! Well, I really just play minecraft. Sometimes modded, usually vanilla. [This is the pack I use for vanilla servers](/files/mc-client/krafter-mcpack-v0.1.zip), based on [trainb0y's better visuals](https://modrinth.com/modpack/trainb0ys-visual-pack).

PC enthusiast? [I am too!](/pc) I mostly watch [LTT](https://www.youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips). 

## Projects

- [Tiramisu](https://github.com/RoseSMP/Tiramisu): an open-source all-purpose, extensible discord bot for communities, with elegance and simplicity in mind.
- [Groupings](https://github.com/TheKrafter/Groupings): A **very WIP** GroupMe client in Python and GTK4/Libadwaita
- [MolarMass](https://github.com/TheKrafter/MolarMass): A crappy low-feature molar mass calculator in GTK + Python, that I have yet to figure out how to make adaptive.
