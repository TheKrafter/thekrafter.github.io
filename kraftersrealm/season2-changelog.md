# Krafter's Realm Season 2 Changelog
All of the things we've changed in Season 2 of the SMP:


## Gameplay
- Minecraft 1.20!
- There's a nice little hut at spawn (with the shop to shop for shopkeepers for your shops)
- You can now craft invisible item frames! See [the crafting page](/kraftersrealm/crafting)
- All mobs have a 10% chance of dropping their head when killed by a player
- All players have a 75% chance of dropping their head when killed by another player
- Mob spawners drop if broken with silk touch
- Phantoms ignore players who have used a bed in the past 3 minecraft days
- Phantoms spawned in for you will despawn when you sleep or die
- When a bedrock player performs an emote, it switches the item in their main and offhand

## Balancing
- No more teleportation! (Including `/back`, `/home`, `/warp`, and `/tpa`)
- Death chests last 24 hours
- Several overpowered extra crafting recipies have been removed (and there's a new list of recipies [here](/kraftersrealm/crafting))

## Claims
- You only get +60 claim blocks per hour (previously it was +100)
- After 60 days (previously 21) when your claim gets automatically removed, nature is restored
- You can't open trapdoors in claims you're not trusted in
- You *can* read lecterns in claims you're not trusted in
- Claims now only have to be a minimum 5 by 4 blocks large

- We have a fancy new tab menu on java edition

- The map no longer has to be manually updated every week
- No longer hosted in a Docker Container
- Connections go through the Velocity proxy before connecting to the internal minecraft server (this will help ease these kinds of transitions)

- The server has updated from Fedora Server 36 to Fedora Server 37
- Minecraft users chatting in `#ingame-chat` no longer have `[MC]` after their username
- The autocomplete for commands now only shows commands you can use
- We now have a secret panel (just for me) to see general server statistics (like performance and player count over time)

- You can view your playtime with `/playtime`
- There are cool-looking holograms at spawn with info, a leaderboard, and your playtime stats
