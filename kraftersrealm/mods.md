# Rules for Minecraft Mods
- [Back](/kraftersrealm)

While it is fun to make your minecraft client work better for you, we try to keep things fair and not let people have an advantage over other players. Here, we have two lists of rules. If a mod you use is described by something under the "Not Allowed" category, you must remove it. If it is described by something under the "Allowed" category, you should use it! If it is not under either category, **use it with caution**. 

## Not Allowed
Mods and resource packs that are not allowed are ones that...

- Allow you to see blocks or entities through solid blocks
- Allow you to find ores significantly easier
- Provide minimaps that show more detail than or things not displayed on [our official map](https://kraftersmap.ddns.net)
- Automate ingame tasks or movement


## Allowed
You are fully allowed to use resource packs and mods that...

- Change how players look
- Show crafting recipies
- Adapt inventory management
- Show hidden minecraft stats (like Saturation)
- Make things prettier (like shaders or *Continuity*)
- Make minecraft perform better
- Remove Mojang's telemetry and chat reporting
- Modify the UI
