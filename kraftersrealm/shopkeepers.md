# Shopkeepers

Shopkeepers allow people to buy stuff from you at a fixed price even while you're not on, and if they're not trusted in your claim.

For how to use shopkeepers, refer to the [*Player Shop Setup*](https://github.com/Shopkeepers/Shopkeepers-Wiki/wiki/Player-Shop-Setup) guide from the developers of Shopkeepers.
