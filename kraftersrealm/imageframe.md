# Images on Maps
- [Back](/kraftersrealm)

Thanks to the *ImageFrame* plugin, you can upload images and put them on maps within our world.

- [Get an existing ImageMap](#get-an-existing-image)
- [Create ImageMaps](#create-imagemaps)
- [Markers](#markers)
- [All Commands](#all-commands)

### Get an existing image

To get an existing ImageMap, use the following command:
```
/frame get <name> combined
```
- Replace `<name>` with the name of your ImageMap
- `combined` is optional, but gives you one combined map

### Create ImageMaps

**[Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/N0PnFbWPD1A)**

1. Upload your image via [img.krafterdev.xyz](https://img.krafterdev.xyz) and copy the URL.
   - Your image can be a `png`, `jpg`, or animated `gif`. Animated `gif` images are played at 20 fps.
   - ONLY images uploaded via the link above are accepted. (That is, to `litter.catbox.moe`)

2. Figure out where you want to place your image, and place the appropriate item frames.

3. Use the following command to create the required maps.
   ```
   /frame create <name> <url> <width> <height> combined
   ```
   *Do not include the `<`, `>`, `[`, or `]` when using the command.*
   - `<name>`: the name for your imagemap
   - `<url>`: the URL for your image from Step 1
   - `<width>`: the width to make the image, in blocks
   - `<height>`: the height to make the image, in blocks
   - `<combined>`: optionally specify `combined` at the end of the command, to get one *ImageMap* item instead of individual maps

### Markers

You can add banner markers to maps with the following command. They show up on all copies of the map.

Use the command, and then right-click where to place it on the image map.
```
/frame marker add <image_name> <marker_name> <direction:0-15> <marker_type> [optional:caption]
```
- `<image_name>`: the name of your imagemap
- `<marker_name>`: the name of the marker (for editing later)
- `<direction>`: the rotation of the banner icon, 0-15
- `<marker_type>`: the type of marker to place (i.e. banner_red, red_x, ...)
- `[caption]`: (optional) the label for the marker on the map
