# Krafter's Realm Rules

These are rules for the Krafter's Realm minecraft server and accompanying discord server.

2. Respect others - like, seriously. don't be a prick.
3. No swearing or inappropriate language
4. No inappropriate builds or skins - this includes any builds or skins that promote rulbreaking, hate speech, or sexual content
5. No discrimination - we are an inclusive and respecting community and do not tolerate discrimination based on any grounds.
6. Staff have the final word - I or any other staff members have the final say on what is or is not inkeeping with these rules
7. Have fun! - ultimately, we want everyone to enjoy their time on the server
8. Follow Discord's ToS and Community Guidelines, along with Mojang's EULA.
