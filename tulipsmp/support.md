# Tulip SMP - Support

- [Back](/tulipsmp/)

### Hey, I'm Krafter!

I run Tulip SMP out-of-pocket because I want to create a diverse and inclusive community of players from all walks of life, without requiring financial contributions to have an enjoyable time. 

Because of this philosophy, your donations to me don't give ANY ingame perks, benefits, or gain of any kind. You just get bragging rights, a discord role, and an ingame tag. *(For this to work, make sure you have a Ko-Fi account and have linked it with your Discord Account. You can do so [here](https://ko-fi.com/Discord/Settings). Syncing can take time, once your discord role is applied it can take up to 5 minutes to sync into minecraft.)*

### Thanks for Your Support!
