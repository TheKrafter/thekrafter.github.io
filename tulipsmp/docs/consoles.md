# Joining on Consoles
- [Back](/tulipsmp)

Minecraft Bedrock edition for consoles does not officially support third-party servers. Because of this, **I cannot guarantee that you will be able to join Tulip SMP from a console**. 

However, here is the reccommended way to join if you *must* use a console:

1. Find the DNS settings in your console's settings
2. Change the DNS server IP to either `173.82.100.84` or `104.238.130.180`. 
3. In Minecraft, go to the Servers tab, and join any one of the Featured Servers
4. Now, instead of joining a featured server, you should see a menu appear with the list of featured servers and a button that says "Connect to a Server" at the top
5. Click on "Connect to a Server", and type in __tulip.krafterdev.xyz__ for the IP, and `19132` for the Port. Make sure to turn on "add to server list"
6. Click "Submit" and you will join this server, and it will be added to your list of servers.

For more info on how to join third-party server via console, or how this process works, see the [Bedrock Connect README](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect#readme).
