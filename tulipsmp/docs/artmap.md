# Tulip SMP - ArtMap How-To guide
- [Back](/tulipsmp)

This is a guide on how to use ArtMap! Our thing for drawing art. You can view their full wiki [here](https://gitlab.com/BlockStack/ArtMap/-/wikis/).

*If you are on Bedrock Edition and using a Touch Screen, you will need to enable split controls by going to Settings → Controls: Touch → Split Controls*

## Setup
* Create an Easel to hold your canvas out of leather, string, an item frame, an armor stand, and a stick:

* Create a canvas with an empty map, emeralds, and leather to paint on:

* Create a paintbrush for saving your work (optional, you can also use commands to save and access the menu.):

* Place the easel on the ground, and put your canvas on it

## Usage
* Right click the easel to "ride" it and begin painting
* Right click or click and drag with different dyes to paint!
* Put a dye in your offhand and hold a bucket to fill
* Press shift to dismount, or save and retrieve your artwork by clicking the paintbrush, or using the `/artmap save` command before dismounting the canvas.
* Craft a painting with an empty map to copy it. (Only the author of an atwork can copy it)

## Commands
See [this page](https://gitlab.com/BlockStack/ArtMap/-/wikis/Commands#artmap-commands) for a list of commands.
