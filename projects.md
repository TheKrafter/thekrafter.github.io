# My Projects

I like to work on lots of little things, sometimes they get finished and sometimes they don't!

## Current

- [Tiramisu](https://github.com/RoseSMP/Tiramisu): an open-source all-purpose, extensible discord bot for communities, with elegance and simplicity in mind.
- [Krafterdev.xyz](https://github.com/TheKrafter/thekrafter.github.io): this site, written with HTML, SCSS, and built with Jekyll

## Past

- [Groupings](https://github.com/TheKrafter/Groupings): A half-finished native GroupMe client in Python and GTK4/Libadwaita
    - Got authentication, message sending, and other functionality jankily added. See TODO.md for details, I can unarchive the repo if you'd like to contribute.
- [MolarMass](https://github.com/TheKrafter/MolarMass): A crappy low-feature molar mass calculator in GTK + Python, that I have yet to figure out how to make adaptive.

## Hosting

Along with working on software, I do some fun sysadmin work for myself, to host things. While most of these services aren't publicly available, here's some insight into what I host:

- [ActualBudget](https://actualbudget.org/)
- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
- [Airsonic](https://airsonic.github.io/)
- Minecraft ([Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper), behind [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity), via [PufferPanel](https://www.pufferpanel.com/))
- [UptimeKuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/)

With the exception of UptimeKuma (which runs directly on the proxy), these services are hosted on an onsite Fedora Server, proxied through a Debian Contabo VPS (with nginx).
