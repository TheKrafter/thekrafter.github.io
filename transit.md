title: Transit I've Used

# Transit

I love transit! If you want to know *why* transit is better than your car, check out RM Transit's video, [*Why Transit Cities are Better for Everyone*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4s9WDDRE2A). If you want to know my *real* thoughts on cars, [this video by BritMonkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSSNlM3Au1A) explains my thoughts precisely.

These are all the rail transit systems I've been on:

- Auckland Transport Commuter Rail (Auckland, NZ)
- Airport Transit System, O'Hare (Chicago, US)
- London Underground, Circle and Hammersmith & City Lines (London, UK)
- Paris Metro (Paris, FR)
- Paris RER (Paris, FR)
- MetroLink (St. Louis, US)

And here are the ones I want to ride some day:

- Amtrak (US)
- Chicago 'L' (US)
- National Rail (UK)
- Elizabeth Line (London, UK)
- Glasgow Metro (Glasgow, UK)
